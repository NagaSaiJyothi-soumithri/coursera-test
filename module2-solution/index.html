                         <div><p>COVID-19.This stands for the coronavirus disease of 2019, when it was first identified. Originally called the "2019 novel coronavirus," is the highly contagious disease spreading across most parts of the globe. It is believed to be spread primarily by respiratory droplets from infected people. Fever, cough and shortness of breath are hallmark symptoms. Currently there is no vaccine or proven treatment for the virus that may cause severe respiratory disease, typically pneumonia, requiring hospital intensive care and which can be lethal. However, many people experience few or fairly mild flu-like symptoms and recover within a week or two.</p></div>
